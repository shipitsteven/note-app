# Note App

Our note app is a simple note taking app that allows you to store notes in markdown format.

## Getting Started

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as our package manager.

> If you do not have Yarn, you can install it globally by running `npm install -g yarn`.

To start the app, jump into the _/client_ directory by running `cd client`, then run `yarn start`.
